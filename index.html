              <h3>Rich in Antioxidants</h3>
              <p>Many of us enjoy honey and incorporate it into our daily diet, whether as a
                natural sugar substitute for our coffee or simply as a sweet treat. But
                specific honey varietals known as "active" honeys have also been utilised
                throughout history for their antibacterial and medicinal properties.</p>
              
            </div>
            <div class="benefits-of-honey">
              <h3>Natural Cough Medicine</h3>
              <p>Honey is a time-honored remedy for a sore throat. According to one study
                , it can also relieve coughs more effectively than OTC medications that
                contain dextromethorphan (DM), a cough suppressant. You can create
                your own remedy at home by mixing up to 2 teaspoons of honey with
                herbal tea or warm water and lemon</p>
              
            </div>
            <div class="benefits-of-honey">
              <h3>Lowers Blood Pressure</h3>
              <p>Blood pressure is an important risk factor for heart disease, and honey
                may help lower it. This is because it contains antioxidant compounds that
                have been linked to lower blood pressure. Studies in both rats and humans
                have shown modest reductions in blood pressure from consuming honey.</p>

         <nav>
          <div class="benefits-of-honey">
              <h3>Improves Cholesterol</h3>
              <p>Studies have shown that consuming honey lowers LDL (bad) cholesterol
                by 6-11% and lowers triglyceride levels by as much as 11%. Honey may
                also increase HDL (good) cholesterol by about 3%.</p>
              
            </div>
            <div class="benefits-of-honey">
              <h3>Improves Heart Health</h3>
              <p>It's high in antioxidants, such as phenolic acids and flavonoids, which may
                support better health. Small studies in humans show honey's antioxidants
                could help improve cholesterol levels, which could help decrease the risk
                for heart disease, although larger long-term studies are needed to confirm
                those findings.</p>

            <div class="benefits-of-honey">
              <h3>Antibacterial Properties</h3>
              <p>Honey contains hydrogen peroxide, which may account for some of its
                antibacterial properties. It also has a high sugar content, which can help
                stop the growth of certain bacteria. Additionally, honey has a low pH level.
                This works to pull moisture away from bacteria, causing the bacteria to get
                dehydrated and die off.</p>
